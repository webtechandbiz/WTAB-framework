# WTAB-framework
Basic login / PHP pages wrapper, someway / somehow compatible with a famous forgotten framework.

# README
1) always implement the "apache http authentication" on the project folder because the login section is not 100% secure
2) create a database and adapt the sqldump.sql structure
3) change -change-here.php and .htaccess file to set the domain and db details

Some personal notes:
I kinda forked an old project I wrote years ago, before adopt Zend Framework for every PHP application I made in the latest years. Zend Framework has became a different project in the meanwhile. I'm happy I always used a custom class for the CRUD operations, so I can migrate everything with less effort.
