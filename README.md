# WTAB-framework
Basic login / PHP pages wrapper, someway / somehow compatible with a famous forgotten framework

# README
1) always implement the "apache http authentication" on the project folder because the login section is not 100% secure
2) create a database and adapt the sqldump.sql structure
3) change -change-here.php and .htaccess file to set the domain and db details
